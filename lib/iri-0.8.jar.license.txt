The Jena IRI Library is built on top of other sub-systems which we gratefully acknowledge:

ICU4J 3.4
IBM X License, local copy
JFlex 1.4.1
This is used to produce some of the source files in the directory com.hp.hpl.jena.iri.impl, i.e. the files Lexer*.java, from source definition files. The license terms for JFlex are GPL. No JFlex distribution (either source or binary) is included with the IRI distribution. If you need to regenerate the Lexer*.java files:
refer to AbsLexer.java, and PatternCompiler.java,
download JFlex 1.4.1
This step is not needed, either to run or compile the Jena IRI Library. The files Lexer*.java, are covered under the Jena license, under the terms of the JFlex license, specifically:
The code generated by JFlex inherits the copyright of the specification it
was produced from. If it was your specification, you may use the generated
code without restriction.
